# ðŸ§  Integrating Stock Market and Economic Indicators for Financial Trend Analysis

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationships between **stock market performance** and **macroeconomic indicators** using Python, SQL, and financial data APIs. By integrating real-time data from **Yahoo Finance** and **FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)**, the goal is to uncover how economic variables such as interest rates, inflation, and GDP growth correlate with stock market trends over time.

Ultimately, this project will serve as a **data-driven framework** for understanding financial market dynamics â€” combining ETL workflows, data visualization, and statistical modeling to generate actionable insights.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Collect and integrate financial and economic data from **multiple APIs** (Yahoo Finance & FRED).  
- Clean and transform datasets into a consistent format for time-series analysis.  
- Identify correlations and lag effects between market indices (e.g., S&P 500, NASDAQ) and key economic indicators.  
- Build predictive models to estimate **market direction** or **volatility trends** based on macroeconomic signals.  
- Visualize findings through **interactive dashboards** for interpretation and exploration.

## ðŸ§© Planned Tech Stack
| Layer | Tools & Libraries |
|-------|--------------------|
| **Data Collection (ETL)** | Python, `yfinance`, `fredapi`, `pandas`, `requests` |
| **Database Management** | SQLite (initial), PostgreSQL (future deployment) |
| **Data Analysis** | `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels` |
| **Visualization** | `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, Plotly/Dash or Streamlit |
| **Version Control & Workflow** | GitHub, Git tagging, Jupyter Notebooks |

## ðŸ“Š Planned Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   Fetch stock price data and economic indicators using APIs.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Integration:**  
   Align timeframes, handle missing values, and normalize datasets.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Investigate correlations, lag patterns, and stationarity.  

4. **Modeling & Evaluation:**  
   Test regression and time-series models (e.g., ARIMA, VAR, Random Forest).  

5. **Visualization & Reporting:**  
   Build an interactive dashboard and summary report displaying major findings.

## ðŸš€ Roadmap
- [ ] Implement ETL scripts for Yahoo Finance and FRED  
- [ ] Create SQL schema and load cleaned data  
- [ ] Conduct exploratory analysis and generate key plots  
- [ ] Develop baseline regression and time-series models  
- [ ] Build and deploy dashboard  
- [ ] Write final report summarizing insights

## ðŸ§  Learning Focus
This project explores the intersection of **data science, economics, and finance**, aiming to strengthen skills in:
- Financial data engineering and automation  
- Time-series modeling and feature correlation  
- Predictive analytics for macroeconomic trends  
- Dashboard design and stakeholder communication  

---

## ðŸª™ Future Directions
Once the initial workflow is complete, planned enhancements include:
- Expanding to **international markets and indicators**  
- Incorporating **sentiment data** from news and social media  
- Deploying the dashboard to a **cloud platform (e.g., Render, AWS, or GCP)**  
- Automating data updates through scheduled API calls
